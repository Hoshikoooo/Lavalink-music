# Splash Music #
This is a music bot for my [splash](https://github.com/Tibor309/splash) bot project, which is based of lavalink from the original [lavamusic](https://github.com/brblacky/lavamusic) project. This bot was made for my friends, and i don't want to release it. This version only has the theme changed, and some files.

## Setup
To setup this fork of the project, just simply follow the original [instructions](https://github.com/brblacky/lavamusic#readme). The requirements are the same as the original's.
