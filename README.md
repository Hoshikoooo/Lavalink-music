# Splash Music #
This is the 2nd version of my music bot, which is based of lavalink from the original [lavamusic](https://github.com/brblacky/lavamusic) project. This bot was made for my friends.

## Setup
To setup this fork of the project, just simply follow the original's [instructions](https://github.com/brblacky/lavamusic#readme) and watch the tutorial [here](https://youtu.be/x5lQD2rguz0). The requirements are the same as the original's.
